Main objective:
==============
Use GA or some Intelligent Algorithm to automatically build a CNN ( with specific layer number and filter size )

###Auxiliary works:
  * How to train a CNN unsupervisedly
  * How to determine whether a CNN(feature abstractor) is better than others?
  * How to reuse the precedent training to accelerate the following training

Update in 2018:
- This is one of my first research attemps which was terminated due to the computational limit.
- Glad to see something like AutoML appears.
